Technology has always been a key part of my life and I knew very early on that it would proceed to consume my future. I started coding in high school, tinkering with different languages to see what intrigued me, but I was never able to really get into it. Once I started school at Chico State and became surrounded by an avid community, my intrigue skyrocketed and I dived head first into the wealth of knowledge that was now available to me. I have been developing full-time, whether for school or work, since 2014 and have found my  greatest joy in jumping into a new language or technology that opens up a completely different area of the field for me. I am always learning about several new technologies at once, whether its a framework or a language or a package,  and I never intend to stop.
