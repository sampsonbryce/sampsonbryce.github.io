### Projects:

Developed a desktop graphical user interface, CDATGUI, for a large open source climate data analysis
tool developed at the lab. The project was originally in Python and Pyside Qt, but was later
dropped from development. I developed the frontend of the replacement, vCDAT, using React/Redux with
ES6 Javascript using tools such as Webpack for bundling modules. The application interfaces
with a Flask API which provides the functionality from the climate data analysis tool.
